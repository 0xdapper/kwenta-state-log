title: Adjust trading reward eligibility
status: Draft
created: 2022-02-16
section: 3.4
--

### Simple Summary
Adjust the trades eligible for trading rewards in order to focus rewards on Kwenta traders.

### Abstract
Kwenta's trading rewards currently reward all volume regardless of the source. Upcoming trading incentives from Synthetix are expected to increase volume from multiple frontends and trading bots. Trading rewards will be limited to trades with KWENTA tracking code. This change will impact the following:
* Remove incentives for volume generated by other Perps V2 frontends.
* Remove incentives for volume generated by trading bots and smart contracts.
* Remove incentives for fees paid during liquidations.

### Motivation
This change will focus rewards toward geniune users of Kwenta by limiting rewards to those using Kwenta's frontend or SDK. In it's current state, Kwenta user volume could be outnumbered by trading executing arbitrage trades, which dilutes the rewards going to actual traders. Additionally this limits trading fees to trading volume by removing liquidation fees, which are paid to external keepers and to Synthetix.

### Specification
* Update the trading rewards distribution script in the following ways:
* Update the API endpoint to the Perps V2 subgraph: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/kwenta/optimism-perps
* Add a filter to futuresTrades where trackingCode is equal to KWENTA

This proposes the following change to Section 3.4 of the KSL:

It’s important to note that 𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑠_𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑑 is used here rather than 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 to prevent abuse. Since different markets will have lower fees than others (e.g. FOREX markets may have extremely low fees), malicious stakers may inflate their rewards by trading large volumes in low fee markets. Using 𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑠_𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑑 levels the playing field for all stakers.
