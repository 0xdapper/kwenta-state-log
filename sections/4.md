## Roadmap Development Process

Any time a new council is voted in, it will be the responsibility of the Elite Council, in collaboration with Core Contributors, to establish a refreshed roadmap. The Elite Council President will be accountable for coordinating the development of the roadmap. The roadmap will need to pass a feasibility check by all Core Contributors (CCs) where consensus is reached amongst CCs that they are comfortable with the scope of work and direction. If the roadmap does not receive majority support within the council or amongst CCs, the roadmap will need to be adjusted until it passes both checks.

Once the roadmap is approved, the Core Contributors will work to establish a delivery schedule reflective of the roadmap. As new KIPs are introduced, the CCs will be tasked with updating the delivery schedule to accommodate for the newly passed KIPs.

Milestones on the roadmap will include budgets of KWENTA bonuses for the adminDAO to distribute according to the involvement of relevant Contributors if the milestones are completed. The milestone bonuses are not bound by the dates they are scheduled for as there will inevitably be delays; additionally incentivizing early completion will drive timely development. The treasuryDAO will send the KWENTA to the adminDAO upon confirmed completion of a given milestone. It will be the responsibility of the Elite Council to confirm once a milestone has been reached. It will be the responsibility of the Management Contributors to define what qualifies as a completed milestone. It will be the responsibility of the treasuryDAO to determine a given epoch roadmap's milestone rewards budget.

## Decentralized Deployment

### Frontend

The Elite Council and Core Contributors manage a multisig which requires 2/6 votes, 5 of which are held by Elite Council members and 1 of which is held by the Core Contributors (any Core Contributor). Transaction-based execution directs which version of the code the official Kwenta ENS is pointing to on IPFS. This official version of Kwenta can be reached at: <https://kwenta.eth.limo>

### Code Repository

The Kwenta source code is distributed through a decentralized code collaboration network called Radicle. The elected Elite Council votes on the repository it endorses as the official DAO reference point for source code updates to the Kwenta IPFS deployment. The endorsed decentralized code project for Kwenta is:

`rad:git:hnrkdc9jh3a1ud7k3spy9pper1ptbkh55yy5y`

And can be found at: <https://app.radicle.network/seeds/maple.radicle.garden/rad:git:hnrkdc9jh3a1ud7k3spy9pper1ptbkh55yy5y>

Due to Radicles current limitations while under active development, a gradual step-by-step approach is applied to avoid interruptions to the protocols development while giving contributors the chance to become familiar with Radicle and iron out any hiccups along the way.

In case of disagreements, abandonment or forks of the endorsed Kwenta source code project, community members can put forward requests to the Elite Council in order to vote on alternative project ids being supported and officially endorsed.

## Asset Listing Process

In the event the Synthetix protocol supports a new synth, the Kwenta protocol will automatically list the asset and make it available for use in the product. Kwenta shall not take custodial control over users' assets and shall continue to act as a decentralized trading protocol.

## Cross Margin

Cross margin opens the door for new trading strategies and increases the accessibility of futures on Kwenta. It is an abstraction layer to be built on top of the Synthetix Futures (V1) protocol which creates "margin accounts" for each trader. Margin accounts enable Kwenta to simplify rebalancing operations and provide cross margin functionality.

The current futures system requires traders to deposit margin into specific markets before trading. This two step process causes friction when trying to act on market conditions and when managing margin between multiple markets. Cross margin improves the UX of trading on Kwenta.

With the introduction of a "margin account" system, each trader will be required to set up a smart contract wallet (this step is managed by the frontend) that holds margin on behalf of the trader. Smart contract accounts also open the door for future functionality as seen under [advanced orders](./4.md#advanced-orders).

Cross margin is achieved by bundling together the margin step and the trade step when modifying a futures position. With the current implementation a trader can also open/modify/close multiple positions at once (atomically). It will be up to the frontend implementation on how to manage and rebalance margin.

### Rationale & User Flows

As a **trader** I want:
* To manage positions on **a singular asset**:
    * By opening BTC position without having to perform two transactions.
    * By opening BTC position using the margin from closing a LINK position.

* To manage positions on **a basket of assets**:
    * By opening positions across many markets in one step.
    * By rebalancing all assets at once to keep leverage constant and avoid liquidation
* To speculate on the **ratio between two asset prices**:
    * By opening pair trade ETH/SOL in one step.
    * By rebalancing a pair trade with profits from a drifting asset.

### Technical Specification

There will be a factory contract (MarginAccountFactory) that creates new margin accounts. Each margin account's functionality will be restricted to the owner of the account, which is the original creator. 

The current architecture relies on [MinimalProxies](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167) where each margin account is a minimal proxy. This substantially decreases the gas costs of account creation at the expense of slightly increased interaction cost. Events are emitted on account creation and these are expected to be indexed by a subgraph.

`distributeMargin` is the core function of Cross Margin and accepts an array of `NewPosition` structs.

`function distributeMargin(NewPosition[] memory _newPositions);`

Each position defined via NewPosition will specify the market, margin Δ (delta), and size Δ.

```
struct NewPosition {
        bytes32 marketKey;
        int256 marginDelta;
        int256 sizeDelta;
}
```

A positive margin Δ will deposit margin into a specified market and a negative margin delta will withdraw margin from a specified market.

A positive size Δ will increase the notional size of a position. A negative size Δ will decrease the notional size of a position. A sufficiently large size Δ may invert the direction of a position (long vs. short).

A position can be closed if the passed size Δ is the exact inverse of the current size. When closing a position, all margin in that market will be withdrawn back to the user's margin account in a single transaction.

### Fee Structure

Fees can be imposed on all trades placed through the cross margin contract. The fee will be a function of size delta but not margin delta. Fees are additive on top of Synthetix base fees. The fee will be controlled through governance. The fee will initially be set at 2 basis points and revenue will be sent to the treasury.

### Caveats

An expectation of typical cross margin is rebalancing. This iteration does not include rebalancing due to keeper system constraints. It will be up to the end user to balance their margin. For example if a trader opens two positions with equal margin for both, over time their positions will become unbalanced respective to market movements and it will be possible for one position to be liquidated before the other.

## Advanced Orders

Advanced orders enable new trading strategies for futures. Leveraging Gelato's keeper system, Kwenta will automate specialized orders for futures. The first two products utilizing this are limit orders and stop orders.

Market orders are the only available order type (next-price orders are market orders under the hood) for Kwenta futures at the moment. There are trading benefits by allowing orders to execute in the future based on defined conditions.

Advanced orders are now feasible as a result of "margin accounts" introduced with [cross Margin](./4.md#cross-margin).

A trader can specify a limit order or stop market order and register the task with Gelato. If the specified condition evaluates true, Gelato keepers will execute the order on behalf of the trader. Keeper fees are paid in ETH (on execution) and will be required to be stored in the margin account for future execution.
Margin will be committed for an advanced order meaning it cannot be used for any other order or cross margin while the order is active.

### Slippage

Users specify a price for the execution of their order, however trades are always executed at the current oracle price. Thus, a trader's buy order may be filled at a price below their specified order resulting in positive slippage. Similarly, a trader's stop loss may trigger at a price below their specified order resulting in negative slippage. Below are detailed examples of each scenario:

* If the next oracle price falls below a given limit price during an order to open a long, (ie. $400 to buy ETH & new oracle price = $398) the order will experience positive slippage and will execute at $398.

* If the next oracle price falls below a given stop loss price for an order to close a long, (ie. $400 stop loss & new oracle price = $398) the order will experience negative slippage and will execute at $398.

### Rationale & User Flow

As a **trader** I want:
* To gain exposure at a particular price:
    * By placing a limit open to buy/sell an asset at a given price or better.
* To reduce risk on a bounce or take profits on a position:
    * By placing a limit close to sell/buyback an asset at a given price or better.
* To catch a trend:
    * By placing a stop order to enter a trade at a given price.
* To cap downside on a trade:
    * By placing a stop loss order to sell a declining asset (if long) or buy a rising asset (if short) at a given price.

### Technical Specification

All advanced orders are indexed by orderId. orderId is a counter that starts from 0 and increments with each order placed. There are three key functions for interacting with advanced orders:

* Placing an order. This stores the order on chain until execution or cancellation.

```
function placeOrder(
    address market, 
    int256 marginDelta, 
    int256 sizeDelta, 
    uint256 targetPrice,
    OrderTypes orderType // LIMIT or STOP
) payable external onlyOwner;
```

*This function is payable because a trader is responsible for providing ETH to their margin accounts to pay for Gelato executed transactions. Note that the margin account must have a minimum of 0.01 ETH before orders can be placed.*

* Canceling an order. This removes an order for a given market.

`function cancelOrder(address market) external onlyOwner;`

* Executing an order. This will be executed by a keeper when a condition is true.

`function executeOrder(address market) external onlyOps;`

When an order is placed, margin is committed to that order. This prevents weird UX loopholes where margin expected for a limit order can accidentally be used by other orders or cross margin. Committed margin is also not eligible for withdrawal from the margin account. The remaining amount of freeMargin is visible in the contract with:

`function freeMargin() public view returns (uint256);`

Additionally, due to the volatility and unpredictability of the [dynamic fee](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-184/) orders can specify a cap on the dynamic fee that can be charged to a position modification. This is enabled through a separate order placement function:

```
function placeOrderWithFeeCap(
        ...,
        uint256 maxDynamicFee
) payable external onlyOwner;
```

### Fee Structure

Fees are charged for each advanced order executed. There are two new fees users are accountable for, the Keeper fee (Gelato) and the Kwenta fee. Kwenta fee parameters will be controlled through governance. Fees will initially be sent to the treasury.
At the start market order fees will be set to 0.2%. All advanced orders are subject to cross margin fees when executed.

| Order Type  | Kwenta Fee | Keeper Fee |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Limit       | 3 bp        | Dependent on network congestion (ETH)  |
| Stop        | 3 bp        | Dependent on network congestion (ETH)  |

## Synth Swap

Leveraging 1inch (smart contracts and API) and Synthetix, Kwenta will enable the exchange of any ERC20 tokens for any synths (and vice versa) directly on its platform. The first iteration will support most ERC20 tokens that can be swapped on 1inch but will withhold the ability to add custom tokens for swaps.

### Specification

User Flows: As a spot trader, I want:

* Spot exposure with synthetic assets:
    * By swapping my ERC20 tokens or ETH for synths
* To leave the ecosystem:
    * By swapping my synths for ERC20 tokens or ETH

As a futures trader, I want:
* To open positions:
    * By swapping my ERC20 tokens or ETH for sUSD margin

SynthSwap smart contracts utilize both 1inch and Synthetix to execute ERC20 token swaps. SynthSwap provides swap functionality for ETH and 1inch supported ERC20 tokens to synths and vice-versa. Swap aggregation data is generated off-chain via 1inch's API and used on-chain to efficiently execute token exchange through 1inch smart contracts. The Synthetix exchange fills in the last leg of the swap if needed (if swapping Synth <-> Synth). This allows for users to go from ETH to sETH in one transaction vs previously having to go from ETH to sUSD and then a separate transaction for sUSD to sETH.
